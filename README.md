# Machine-Learning

In this Project i tried to build neural network that predicts the salary of an employee based on their number of years of experience.

So, base pay of 50k someone with no experience and every additional year of experience gives you an additional 10k.

I careated a neural network that learn this relationship so that it would predict that an employee with 8 years of experience should earn 130k.
